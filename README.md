# Ideapad Control
Controls and displays settings for the Lenovo Ideapad 5 15ARE05 only.  
Do not use this with any other laptop including the Lenovo Ideapad 5 14ARE05. Blame Lenovo.   

Made using information and commands from the laptop's [ArchWiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_IdeaPad_5_15are05).  
Special thanks to ArchWiki user Bad Taste for figuring out the acpi commands.
